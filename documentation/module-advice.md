## Goal
Take it as your personal goal to learn a new technology and to create a project that you and your group members are proud of.

## Tips
- First learn all the topics in the course (see Leho).
- Stick to the Leho documentation, it's more than enough.
  - In this module you will learn to use official documentation.
- Start by creating a simple project with a simple page and database consumption.
- Watchout with ChatGPT (knowlegde cuttoff before .NET 8)
- Give each member clear tasks that don't overlap with other members.
- Use the project requirements as a checklist.
- Don't start with the project in may!
- Copilot Chat in the IDE can be your best friend.
- Keep thing scoped, this project should totally not be the size of the programming project or the analysis and development project.
